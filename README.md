# project1

I made this project to determine if there was a correlation between temperatures and COVID cases. 
I wanted to know if higher daily temperature meant less daily cases and if lower daily temperature meant more daily cases.


Program plots two graphs:
* graph1 : high and low temperatures recorded in Los Angeles from March 13, 2020 to March 12, 2021
* graph2 : daily COVID cases recorded in California from March 13, 2020 to March 07, 2021

this project contains three files:
* csv file for LA daily temperatures
* csv file for CA daily COVID cases
* python program for visualizing the data

# IMPORTANT
user must change the file directory when assigning the csv files to file1 and file2 on "covidWeather.py"
